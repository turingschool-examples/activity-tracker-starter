## What is this project?

### This project `FitLit` is a practice repo to accomplish the following:
- write multiple classes which communicate with each other through html scripts
- write robust test suites for each class
  - check for happy and sad paths in tests
  - maintain ability to test while having implementation files connected to DOM
- cleanly separate data model and DOM
- display multiple formats worth of data to DOM
  - data for a user, a day, a week, etc.
- make page responsive so can display to both mobile and desktop views

## What does this project do?

- for a user:

  - be able to switch any of the data breakdowns to a last week view instead
  - be usable on both a mobile device and a desktop
